        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced cheese (our favorite is thick-sliced, medium cheddar)</li>
            <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
            <li>Fresh red onions (or caramelized onions)</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Green leaf or iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Bacon + pineapple + the BBQ sauce below</li>
            <li>Jalapeños to add some heat</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use Ground Chuck Beef (80/20) – grind your own or buy it ground, but 20% fat is ideal and keep it refrigerated until you’re ready to use it.</li>
            <li>Don’t overwork your meat – this will make it tough and dense.</li>
            <li>Shape the patties 1” wider than the bun since they shrink on the grill.</li>
            <li>Make an indentation in the center to prevent it from plumping up in the center.</li>
            <li>Don’t Season too early – Salt changes the structure of proteins and toughens burgers so don’t season your ground beef until you have formed your patties and are ready to grill.</li>
            <li>Get a good Sear – Once on the grill, let patties brown and sear well (3-5 min) before flipping, and do not press down on the burger save that for making Smash Burgers.</li>
        </ol>
