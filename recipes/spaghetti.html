            <li>2 medium onions</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>17.5oz spaghetti (500g)</li>
            <li>10.5oz cheddar cheese (300g)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This cheesy fried spaghetti is a super easy recipe but I’ll go into detail in this section and include some photos of the process so you can check back here if you have any doubts while making it.</li>
            <li>Then chop up your onions (I always do this under the extractor fan so they don’t irritate my eyes), seed and chop the tomatoes, and grate the cheese.</li>
            <li>I use cheddar cheese and highly recommend it, but you can use any sharp hard cheese such as jack, colby, gouda, etc.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan (make sure it’s non-stick) on high heat. Add in the onions and stir. You’re going to leave the onions to fry for about five-eight minutes until quite brown (as in image number one below) but you’ll need to stir them often to stop them from sticking and burning.</li>
            <li>Don’t forget to add the spaghetti to the pot when the water comes to a boil. When it comes back to the boil, set a timer for 10-11 minutes and leave to cook, stirring the odd time to separate the strands).</li>
            <li>Keep stirring the onions regularly and when they’re nice and brown you can add the tomatoes and the teaspoon of salt (as in image number two above), and turn the heat down to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Stir the onion and tomato mixture well and leave to cook for about five minutes, stirring the odd time, or until the tomatoes have broken down (they should look like image number three above).</li>
            <li>Drain your spaghetti well when cooked al-dente, and add to the pan with the tomatoes and onions (image number four). Toss the spaghetti to make sure it’s well coated with the olive oil tomatoes and onions.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat up to high and sprinkle a third of the grated cheese on top of the spaghetti (see image number one below). Toss quickly with the pasta before it starts to melt, and then let sit for two minutes.</li>
            <li>This is when the magic happens and the cheese starts to melt through all the spaghetti and the spaghetti and cheese bits on the bottom get nice and crispy</li>
            <li>After two minutes, add another third of the cheese, toss again (make sure to lift any crispy bits away from the bottom or they will burn), and let sit two minutes more. Repeat with the final third of the cheese, letting it sit two minutes again.</li>
            <li>Your spaghetti should look like image number two from the photo above. Done!</li>
            <li>Mixing the cheese in three times and letting the cheesy spaghetti sit and fry two minutes each time yields the perfect ratio of gooey cheese to crispy cheesy spaghetti bits for me, but if you like it crispier, then you can let it sit a little longer. Likewise, if you prefer it less crispy, let it sit less time.</li>
            <li>If you have any leftovers, they’ll keep in a tightly sealed container in the fridge for up to five days. To reheat, add a tablespoon of water to the container, shake, and microwave on high for two and a half minutes. I don’t recommend freezing this dish as this spaghetti gets a bit spongy.</li>
